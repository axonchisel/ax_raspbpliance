#
# Configure Raspberry Pi Wifi adapter.
#
# Typically done in initial stages when new Pi is connected via ethernet.
#
# If wifi setup is requested via wifi_setup bool var,
# then it uses vars wifi_ssid and wifi_password to configure
# presumed WPA2 Wifi network by uploading new
# /etc/network/interfaces file.
#
# NOTE: 
# The manner in which we configure Wifi on Raspbian here 
# (writing a few lines into /etc/network/interfaces) is *probably* not 
# the right way.  It does seem to work, but it results in various
# boot time errors, possible packet loss, and possibly other problems.
# This playbook should be revisited by heads more intimately familiar
# with Linux networking and WPA Supplicants (which we ignore here).
